## Description

JobLister is a free and open-source WordPress plugin that allows you to set up a job listing page on your WordPress website using a simple [jbls_jobs] shortcode.

## Development Setup Instructions

This guide outlines the steps to configure the development environment for JobLister. Follow the instructions closely to ensure a successful setup.

### Prerequisites

- Confirm that Docker Desktop is installed and actively running on your system.
- Install `wp-env` globally on your system if it isn't already installed:

  ```sh
  npm -g i @wordpress/env
  ```

### Enviroment Setup

1. Clone repository and navigate to its directory:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/PictureElement/joblister.git
  cd joblister
  ```

2. Install necessary dependencies:

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

3. Deploy a local WordPress instance:

  ```sh
  wp-env start
  ```

4. Access the WordPress dashboard at [http://localhost:8888/wp-admin/](http://localhost:8888/wp-admin/). Use `admin`/`password` as login credentials.

5. Install and activate the [Radio Buttons for Taxonomies](https://wordpress.org/plugins/radio-buttons-for-taxonomies/) plugin, a required dependency for JobLister to function correctly.

6. Navigate to 'Settings > Radio Buttons for Taxonomies' and select `jbls_category`, `jbls_experience_level`, `jbls_location`, and `jbls_type`, and save your changes.

7. To interact with the plugin, insert the [jbls_jobs] shortcode on any page.

8. Begin development with fast refresh:

  ```sh
  npm run start:hot
  ```

## Preparing for Production

When ready to move JobLister into a production environment, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the plugin's directory.

2. Compile the production-ready version:

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

3. Create a distributable zip file:

  ```sh
  npm run plugin-zip
  ```

This process compiles all necessary files into a zip format, ready for deployment in a production environment.

## Future Enhancements

1. Work towards removing the 'Radio Buttons for Taxonomies' plugin as a dependency.
2. Detect network status and alert your users when they've lost internet connectivity. (Offline.js or navigator.onLine).
3. Implement error handling for API GET requests to provide clear user feedback.
4. Accept resumes in more formats.

## Technical Details

### Add Dummy Content Using FakerPress

To make custom post types and custom taxonomies available to FakerPress, set `"public" => true` in the respective post type and taxonomy configurations. However, it's crucial to revert this setting to `"public" => false` if you're operating in a production environment.
